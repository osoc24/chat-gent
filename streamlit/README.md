# Front-end Prototype - StreamLit

This is a working front-end prototype for ChatGent using StreamLit. The following is the link: [ChatGent on StreamLit](https://test-chatgent.streamlit.app/)

Note that it is hosted using a different repository (personal repository of Dina outside of OSOC) due to limited access for 3rd parties such as StreamLit to the OSOC repository.
