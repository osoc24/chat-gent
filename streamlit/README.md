# Front-end Prototype - StreamLit

This is a working front-end prototype for ChatGent using StreamLit. The following is the link to it: [ChatGent on StreamLit](https://test-chatgent.streamlit.app/)

You can also scan the following QR code to open the app on your phone:

Note that it is hosted using a different repository (Dina's personal repository outside of OSOC) due to limited access for 3rd parties such as StreamLit to the OSOC repository. But the code here is the same as the one in that repository.
