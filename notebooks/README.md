# Code Development - Jupyter & SPARQL Notebooks

This folder contains various notebooks as follows:

- [Main Solution](concepts_based_solution.ipynb): This is the pipeline for the developed solution, starting from generating a query based on the user's question, to compiling the final answer using the retrieved decisions from that query.
- [Question Example Selector](./question_example_selector.ipynb): Code to utilize example selectors by LangChain in the pipeline. Ideally, in the case where a large dataset of example user questions and corresponding SPARQL queries is generated, this tool would effectively match the userâ€™s question to an existing example question and use its SPARQL query. As a result, better quality answers can be generated.
- [SPARQL notebook](./labels_querying.sparqlbook): This notebook was used to test out different queries which were later on used when making the example questions & queries json file.
- [Label Narrowing](./label_narrowing.ipynb): This was a test for extending the label export script to also include all children of a label. All off it's functionality is included in the label export script now.
