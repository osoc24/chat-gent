This repository contains source code and some research and documentation for the ChatGent project

With this project, we aim to contribute to District09, the digital agency of the city of Ghent, by developing a prototype smart search engine designed to answer questions related to local decisions from the city of Ghent!

This project was developed during Open Summer of Code 2024, for more information about OSoC, have a look at [osoc.be](https://osoc.be)
